TurboGears2
===========

Next generation Front-to-back web development megaframework built on Pylons.

TurboGears2, provides a comprehensive web development toolkit.  It is designed to help you create the basic outline of a database-driven web application in minutes. 

TurboGears provides you with sane default for designer friendly templates, tools to make  AJAX, and dynamic Javascript driven pages easy on both the browser side and the server side.

TurboGears is a project that is built upon a foundation of reuse and building up. 
In retrospect, much of the code that was home grown in the TurboGears project 
should have been released as independent projects that integrate with TurboGears.
