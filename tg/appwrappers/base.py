    Application wrappers are like WSGI middlewares but
    are executed in the context of TurboGears and work
    with abstractions like Request and Respone objects.

    Application Wrappers can be registered using
    :meth:`.ApplicationConfigurator.register_application_wrapper`
    which will inject them into the next `TGApp` created.

    While they can be any callable, inheriting from this base class
    is strongly suggested as enables additional behaviours and
    third party code might depend on them.

    Application Wrappers require a ``next_handler`` which is
    the next handler to call in the chain and ``config`` which
    is the current application configuration.

        Wrappers are called for each request with the ``controller`` in charge
        of handling the request, the ``environ`` of the request and the
        TurboGears ``context`` of the request.

        They should call the ``next_handler`` (which will accept the same
        parameters) and return a :class:`tg.request_local.Response` instance
        which is the request response.
        Usually they will return the same response object provided
